# JASSH - JANALYSE-SSH - SCALA SSH API

Crosson David - crosson.david@gmail.com

## Remarks & caveats:

```
  => ssh persisted shell session operations must be executed within the same thread,
   (this is jassh.jar default behavior as it transparently add the -Yrepl-sync)    
    do not span a persisted shell session across several threads => it may generates exception

     So be careful when using REPL with default config, as each "evaluation" is done within a new thread !
     Workaround : Start the interpreter (REPL) with the "-Yrepl-sync" option.
     
     No problem with SBT as a scala console started from SBT will execute all its entries in the same thread !
     No problem in scala scripts.
     
  => SCP operations can't retrieve special file such as /proc/cpuinfo, because their size are not known !
     Workarounds : use SFTP  OR  use a command such as "cat /proc/cpuinfo".
     (The last one is the "best workaround", will work in all cases)
     
  => Be aware of the fact that SFTP SSH Channel may be not available, 
     so prefer SCP to maximize scripts / code portability from one system to an other.
     Looks like linux SSHD comes with SFTP by default, but not AIX.
     --> Since 0.9.5-b3 , SSH transfert operations comes with an automatic fallback mechanism with priority to scp
         So prefer using SSH transfert operations, over SSHFtp transferts operations.

  => TAKE CARE OF HOW MANY SESSIONS CAN BE MANAGED SIMULTANEOUSLY. Check sshd configuration
     MaxStartups = 10 (default) the maximum number of concurrent unauthenticated connections to the SSH daemon
     MaxSessions = 10 (default) the maximum number of open sessions permitted per network connection

  => ?? With such MaxStartups configuration (at least with OpenSSH_6.9p1-hpn14v5, OpenSSL 1.0.1p 9 Jul 2015) : 
     ?? MaxStartups 10:30:100
     ?? --> Random failures may occurs ?? more frequently ?? than with just "MaxStartups 10" ??
     ??   com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: session is down
     ??      at com.jcraft.jsch.Channel.sendChannelOpen(Channel.java:762)
     ??   com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: Session.connect: java.net.SocketException: Connection reset
     ??      at com.jcraft.jsch.Session.connect(Session.java:558)

  => AIX sshd & SSHExecChannel (no persistence) doesn't work well when virtual tty is used
     (execWithPty must be keep to false, this is the default value)
     strange behavior : when SFtp subchannel is enabled, the maximum number of ExecChannel in // decrease...
  
  => Take care of system limits for sshd (nofile & nproc)
     Check /etc/security/limits.conf for linux systems
     if nproc max process/threads limit has been reached for the user you want to connect with, 
       you'll get a failure 

  => Password expiration may ask you for a new password, so you can be blocked waiting for a result that never comes.

  => Remember that some operations may require a TTY (or let's rather say a virtual TTY) or behave 
     differently with or without a TTY/VTTY (sudo, mysql, ...)
     
```
